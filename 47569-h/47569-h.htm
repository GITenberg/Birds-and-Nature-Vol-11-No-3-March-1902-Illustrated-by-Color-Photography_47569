<h2 id="c3">THE WINTER WREN.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Troglodytes hiemalis.</i>)</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">How rich the varied choir! The unquiet finch</p>
<p class="t0">Calls from the distant hollows, and the wren</p>
<p class="t0">Uttereth her sweet and mellow plaint at times.</p>
<p class="lr">&mdash;Isaac McLellan, &ldquo;The Notes of the Birds.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The Winter Wren inhabits that part
of North America east of the Rocky
Mountains, breeding chiefly north of the
United States and migrating at the approach
of winter nearly or quite to the
Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>This diminutive form of bird life,
which is also called Bunty Wren and
Little Log Wren, is a denizen of the
forest, and it is more common in those
forests found on bottom lands adjacent
to rivers. It is a shy bird, and does not
seek the intimacy of man as will its
cousin, the house wren. It is seldom
seen far above the ground. In many
places where it does not seem abundant
it may be quite common, for it readily
eludes observation in the underbrush because
of its neutral color. It frequents
old logs, where it may be seen &ldquo;hopping
nimbly in and out among the knotholes
and other hollow places, then flitting
like a brown butterfly to another
place of refuge on the too near approach
of an intruder.&rdquo; Some one has said, &ldquo;Its
actions are almost as much like that of
a mouse as of a bird, rarely using its
wings except for a short flutter from one
bush or stone-heap to another; it creeps
slyly and rapidly about, appearing for an
instant and is then suddenly lost to
view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Winter Wren builds its nest in
the matted roots of an overturned tree,
in brush-heaps, in moss-covered stumps,
or on the side of a tree trunk. It may
be attached to a ledge of rock, and is
occasionally found in some unoccupied
building, especially if it be a log hut in
the woods. The nest is very large and
bulky when compared with the size of
the bird. Dr. Minot describes a nest
that he found in a moss-covered stump
in a dark, swampy forest filled with
tangled piles of fallen trees and branches.
This nest was made of small twigs and
moss. It had a very narrow entrance
on one side, which was covered by an
overhanging bit of moss, which the bird
pushed aside on entering. The nests
are usually more or less globular and
thickly lined with feathers and hair.</p>
<p>This little brown bird, which carries
its tail pertly cocked on high, is a notable
singer. Many have described this song,
or perhaps it is better to say have tried
to do so. But words are too inadequate
to portray this sweetest of woodland
sounds. Reverend Mr. Langille says:
&ldquo;I stand entranced and amazed, my very
soul vibrating to this gushing melody,
which seems at once expressive of the
wildest joy and the tenderest sadness.
Is it the voice of some woodland elf,
breaking forth into an ecstasy of delight,
but ending its lyric in melting notes
of sorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of this song Florence A. Merriam
says: &ldquo;Full of trills, runs, and grace
notes, it was a tinkling, rippling roundelay.
It made me think of the song of
the ruby-crowned kinglet, the volume and
ringing quality of both being startling
from birds of their size. But while the
kinglet&rsquo;s may be less hampered by considerations
of tune, the Wren&rsquo;s song has
a more appealing, human character. It
is like the bird itself. The dark swamps
are made glad by the joyous, wonderful
song.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>And Audubon beautifully expresses
the song as it appealed to him: &ldquo;The
song of the Winter Wren excels that
of any other bird of its size with which
I am acquainted. It is truly musical,
full of cadence, energetic and melodious;
its very continuance is surprising, and
dull indeed must be the ear that thrills
not on hearing it. When emitted, as it
often is, from the dark depths of the
unwholesome swamps, it operates so powerfully
on the mind that it by contrast
inspires a feeling of wonder and delight,
and on such occasions has impressed me
with a sense of the goodness of the Almighty
Creator, who has rendered every
spot of earth in some way subservient
to the welfare of His creatures.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c4">VOICES IN THE GARDEN.</h2>
<p>As the snows were being guarded on
the mountain tops by the gentle herder
Spring two small seeds, dropped from
the same busy hand, fell so near together
in a fresh furrow that they could
hear each other shiver as they struck the
cold, damp earth and were covered over
by the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How cold our bed is,&rdquo; said seed number
One, as a cold chill ran down her
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied seed number Two. &ldquo;But
we will soon get used to this cold, and
when Father Sun sends the sunbeams to
play on our top cover we will get warmth
from their little hot feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this thought seed number Two
snuggled down in her new bed of earth
and pulled the tiny clods around her and
shut her eyes to sleep. But seed number
One still shivered and complained and
wished that she was back in the paper
package so loudly that all her companions
in the furrow were disturbed, especially
number Two, who was lying so
near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you feeling more comfortable?&rdquo;
asked seed number Two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not. I am freezing, and
these cold clods are mashing me. I wish
I was back in the paper though we
were crowded on top of each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you could not grow there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I could be more comfortable.
If it takes these old black clods to make
me grow I don&rsquo;t know that I want to
grow,&rdquo; and she gave a sniff to show her
contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! You don&rsquo;t realize what you are
saying! You are near committing the
unpardonable sin. Do you remember your
promise to Mother Nature as she placed
within your bosom the sacred germ of
life? That promise which you gave to
grow, at the first opportunity, and to do
all within your power to become strong
and vigorous, producing seeds in which
she could place like germs. Then have
you forgotten your dying mother&rsquo;s request
that you live up to this solemn
promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seed number One did not reply, but
gave a little rebellious grunt to show her
state of feelings and remained silent.</p>
<p>This was a great relief to the other
seeds, who were enduring the discomforts
of their new and chilly environments
with as much fortitude as possible, hoping
and believing that their new home
would yet become more comfortable. Finally
all became quiet and they shut their
eyes and waited and dreamed.</p>
<p>The cold, dark night was at last over.
The seeds in their little dark chambers
could not see this, but they knew it was
so when they felt the warm influence of
the sunbeams as it crept stealthily down
through the damp soil and warmed their
cold, wet wrappings. Oh, how it did revive
them! They grew larger as they
tried to express their thankfulness. The
quickening power within pictured to them
bright sunshine, refreshing showers and
warm, balmy nights. But there they lay
helpless in the dark, waiting and dreaming
and dimly feeling that&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Instinct within that reaches and towers</p>
<p class="t">And, groping blindly above for light,</p>
<p class="t0">Climbs to a soul in grass and flowers.</p>
</div>
<p>But the greatest change of all was in
seed number One. She had spent the
dark, cold night in thinking of the promise
she had given and about which she
had been reminded by seed number Two.
Gradually the angry, rebellious feelings
passed away and she began to realize how
sinful her spirit had been. And now that
the warm sunshine had turned the cold,
wet clods into a blessing she most heartily
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
felt ashamed of herself and could get
no rest until she gave some expression to
this feeling. She began by snuggling
closer down among the clods and trying
to make them feel that she was glad to
be among them.</p>
<p>Then she whispered to them softly: &ldquo;I
am so sorry for the rude, impatient, angry
words I spoke yesterday when I first
came among you. Can you forgive
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly we will,&rdquo; said the big clod
that the seed had accused of mashing her.
&ldquo;I know we are rough looking companions
for a tiny seed and oftimes we are
forced, by influences from without, to act
rudely. But Mother Nature knows our
needs and will send water to soften our
natures and men will lift and stir us about
so that we can do our very best work in
helping you and other seeds to perform
life&rsquo;s obligations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the seed, &ldquo;I now remember
how my mother used to praise
you and tell us children that the nice
juicy food she brought for us to eat came
from the soil surrounding her roots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you can remember us so
kindly,&rdquo; responded the clod. &ldquo;Though
we are the lowest of God&rsquo;s creation, we
are also the oldest, and He has most graciously
used us as an instrument in performing
His higher works. We hold a
very humble place, and are trodden upon
by all of His creatures, yet we are happy
in realizing that we, too, have a direct
commission from him and a part to perform
in the creation of the great living
world above us. Our most extensive and
immediate work is helping Mother Nature
to produce the vegetable kingdom,
to which you belong, and we want you to
feel,&rdquo; continued the clod, &ldquo;that you are
among friends who are waiting and anxious
to serve you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied the seed; &ldquo;you
are very, very kind, and I am sure I shall
learn to love you dearly.&rdquo; Saying this
she crept down closer into the warm little
crevice and the clod, absorbing the
water that had been turned into the furrow,
melted around her and gave her
protection, moisture and food.</p>
<p>The next night did not seem so cold to
the seeds. They had become better acquainted
with the soil and through the
influence of the sun and water were
clasped more warmly and tenderly in his
arms. There they lay and waited until
the little germ within them began to stir
and knock for egress. The kind soil had
by his own virtues softened their walls
so that it was not difficult for the swelling
germs to make an opening through
which they stretched tiny white hands and
laid them lovingly into the strong ones
of their benefactor. In these handclasps
were pledged mutual co-operation, sympathy
and love throughout life. &ldquo;Useless
each without the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had these little hands made
sure of their hold upon the soil than there
came an irrepressible longing in the heart
bud to reach up and to know another
world. In obedience to this call the little
bud peeped out of its own hull and crept
softly through the soil, up to the sunshine
and air. There it unfolded two tiny
leaves in thankfulness and praise to One
who had made possible this new life. As
the fullness of the higher world was comprehended,
other leaves were thrown out
until the little plant became a whorl of
praise and gladness.</p>
<p>At this juncture new difficulties arose.
These little leaves forgot their higher
mission of love and praise and began to
crowd and push each other, each striving
to grow tallest and command the greatest
space. As seeds number One and
Two lay very near each other it was not
long before their leaves came together in
the air world. They had been so busy
growing that they had talked but little
to each other since the first night. Seed
number One had grown so happy, gentle
and meek that she was fast gaining
friends on all sides. Every one regretted
that they had so harshly condemned her.
But now this new trial was a severe test
to her genuine heart goodness. At first
she made some show of patience, for
seed number Two, her closest neighbor,
was so unselfish and gentle in all that she
did that there was little excuse to be otherwise.
But no sooner did other leaves
come into the space she considered her
own than her leaves began to rustle and
complain and to say: &ldquo;It is no use for
me to try to grow, crowded up like this.
I wish I had been planted somewhere all
by myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then seed number Two gently whispered:
&ldquo;He who took you from your
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
mother&rsquo;s dead arms, kept you from freezing
during the cold winter months and
prepared for you this nice loose furrow
in which to grow had a right to plant
you where He wished and to do with
you what He thinks best. As for &lsquo;growing
room,&rsquo; there is likely to be plenty of
it within a few days for all those who
have the good fortune to be here.&rdquo; At
this there was a rustle of surprise among
the bystanders and they asked what she
meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember mother telling about her
early life,&rdquo; continued seed number Two,
&ldquo;how at first she and her companions
were so crowded together that some lost
all their beautiful green color and became
white and sickly. But one day a
girl, with a bucket on her arm and a
knife in her hand, came and sat down
near them. They all held their breath,
not knowing what she intended to do.
Then the girl took the knife and, catching
a number of mother&rsquo;s companions by
the leaves, cut them off just below their
bud. This she continued to do until her
bucket was full. When she left there
was plenty of room for those remaining
to grow, but their hearts were sad and
anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each day the girl came back to some
portion of the bed and acted in the same
manner until the bunches were so scattering
that the leaves did not touch each
other. Each time mother expected that
she would be one of the number and be
cut off from the life she loved and in
which she was hoping to redeem her
promise to bear seeds for Mother Nature.
Finally she and her companions began
to notice that the girl always chose the
largest and freshest looking bunches.
Then some of them began to say: &lsquo;What
is the use of us trying our best to grow
strong and vigorous? That very state
endangers our lives. Mother Nature
surely did not understand these surroundings
when she exacted this promise from
us!&rsquo; One bold, rebellious spirit said: &lsquo;I
am going to have my roots stop their
work that my leaves may turn yellow
and brown; and then I will get the wind
to split and break them.&rsquo; &lsquo;But,&rsquo; said
mother, &lsquo;that will be death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, what does it matter? I would
as lief die one way as another,&rsquo; gruffly
responded the bold speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of mother&rsquo;s companions nodded
their assent, so she said nothing more until
she had time to quietly think over the
matter. That night mother stood, awake,
looking up at the stars and trying to know
what was best to do. Finally, when the
first whispers of morning could be heard,
they brought her this message: &lsquo;Always
and under all circumstances do your best.
Live up to the highest and noblest within
you and leave the result to Him who
knows the heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there came peace and courage,
and mother rose above the fear of death
and resolved that she would not relax
one effort to grow and carry out in detail
the promise she had given. She was convinced
that Mother Nature wanted her
best each day rather than a mere existence
in order that she might bear some
puny seeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several days went by and the girl did
not appear. The contrast became greater
and greater between mother and her companions.
She stood erect, holding her
broad green leaves up to the sun, while
in the midst of them could be seen a
young, vigorous seed stalk crowned with
the precious promises of the future. The
leaves of her companions were fast turning
yellow and brown and their whole
attitude was dejected and forlorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day they heard voices in the garden.
They thought this must be the girl
coming to fill her bucket. All eyes were
turned toward mother. They felt sure
she would be the first chosen. But
mother was calm and possessed, rejoicing
in the knowledge that she had lived
up to her higher duties and therefore
was better prepared to either be cut down
or left standing as fate would decide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the voices came nearer they recognized
the owner of the garden and with
her John, who had always been their
good friend, pulling up the weeds and
loosening the soil around their roots. The
owner and John were soon standing beside
the bed where mother and her companions
grew, and then the voice of the
woman could be heard saying: &lsquo;John, this
bed is doing no good. The season is
about over, anyway, so you can spade it
up and sow it to early turnips. But look!&rsquo;
and the woman stooped and touched
mother&rsquo;s crisp leaves. &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t this a beautiful
specimen of fine lettuce? John, you
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
may leave this bunch for seed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it came about that mother only, of
all her companions, was allowed to complete
a natural life and to realize the hope
that we all have in common.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As seed number Two finished this narrative
they were all very thoughtful and
felt more considerate for each other in
their crowded condition.</p>
<p>Sure enough, within the next day or
two a woman with a pan and knife came
down the row and began to thin out their
number. Seed numbers One and Two
trembled as she passed them, but she did
not stop to take either.</p>
<p>That evening seed number One whispered
to her companion: &ldquo;You are very
fortunate to have had such a noble mother.
I know now why it is so easy for
you to be patient and good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you do not know nor understand,
or you would not call me good nor think
that it is easy for me to be always patient.
I love and honor the memory of
my mother, but she does not possess the
power to make me good. Mother Nature
holds each of us responsible for our own
acts and judges us accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a thoughtful silence seed number
One said: &ldquo;I am growing to try to be
good and to grow strong and upright,&rdquo;
and she stretched herself a little bit higher
in her own effort to appear so.</p>
<p>A few days after this a small, tiny
worm came creeping and shivering along
the ground and stopped first under the
leaves of seed number One and asked for
a nibble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the seed, &ldquo;my leaves must
be kept whole and beautiful, for it is
only in this way that I can be my best
self and thereby win Mother Nature&rsquo;s
approval.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am starving,&rdquo; replied the worm.
&ldquo;I cannot find a morsel to eat anywhere.
Please give me one of your under leaves
that I may gain strength to crawl on and
hunt other food. I do not ask your life,
but only a bit of your under leaves, which
you can well spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it will spoil my appearance,&rdquo; said
the seed, &ldquo;and Mother Nature wants me
to be beautiful. And then I can&rsquo;t bear
to have a nasty worm touch me,&rdquo; and she
rustled and drew up her beautiful green
leaves to show her disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the worm, &ldquo;I will
not take by force what you are not willing
to give through mercy. Some day you
will know me better,&rdquo; and the worm
crawled away.</p>
<p>He stopped at seed number Two and
made the same request. At first she hesitated,
but seeing how near starved the
poor worm was and how humbly and
meekly he asked for the food, she relented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said the seed, &ldquo;you will spoil
the appearance of my leaves and I shall
look shabby among my companions, but
knowing that you, too, are one of Mother
Nature&rsquo;s children, I cannot believe that
she would have me withhold life from
you. Therefore, I give you of my leaves
as giving unto her, leaving the result
with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The worm most heartily thanked the
seed and began eating. He stayed a day
or two, making several large holes
through the under leaves, but at the end
of that time he had become strong and
vigorous, and again thanking her, he
crawled away.</p>
<p>Several days after the worm had departed
and seeds numbers One and Two
had grown to be quite large bunches, the
woman with her knife came down the
row. She seemed to be in a great hurry
and was gathering the largest bunches as
she came along. When she reached the
two companions she stooped and laid her
knife at the root of number Two, but
noticing the holes in her leaves she quickly
changed to seed number One and the
knife went home. Poor seed number
One fell over on her side and was gathered
up and placed in the pan. The
woman passed on and seed number Two
was left standing, but shaking with the
emotions of fear, thankfulness and regret.
For after all, she loved seed number
One and was truly sorry that she had
been taken.</p>
<p>All that afternoon seed number Two
remained very quiet and her companions
knew why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; they murmured.
&ldquo;What we thought was her degradation
and destruction has really been her salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they looked upon her with awe
and whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange! How strange!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c5">THE LECONTE&rsquo;S SPARROW.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Ammodramus leconteii.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The Leconte&rsquo;s Sparrow has an interesting
history. It was first discovered
and named by Audubon in 1843. Later,
his account seemed almost a myth, for no
more individuals were taken, and even
the specimen on which he based his published
report of the new species was lost.
It was not seen again until Dr. Coues
rediscovered it in 1873, obtaining his
specimens on the Turtle Mountain, near
the border of Dakota.</p>
<p>Of their habits, Dr. Coues says: &ldquo;In
their mode of flight the birds resemble
wrens; a simile which suggested itself
to me at the time was that of a bee returning
home laden with pollen; they
flew straight and steady enough, but
rather feebly, as if heavily freighted for
their very short wings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Its range is quite extensive, for it is
found from the Great Plains eastward
through Illinois and Indiana and from
Manitoba southward. During the
winter months it frequents the
States bordering the Gulf of Mexico.
This Sparrow is often seen
in the stubble of grain fields which have
become covered with grass and low
weeds, to the cover of which it will retreat
when frightened. In this respect
it resembles the grasshopper sparrow,
and like it is easily overlooked. Mr.
Nelson found it on moist prairies that
were covered with a growth of coarse
grass. It is also frequently seen in the
swampy prairies of the Mississippi bottom
lands.</p>
<p>Mr. Oliver Davie quotes the following
description of the bird&rsquo;s habits from
an observer who studied their habits in
Manitoba, where they nest extensively:
&ldquo;Leconte&rsquo;s Sparrows are fairly numerous
in Manitoba. Their peculiar note
can be heard both day and night in fine
weather; the only sound I can compare
it to is the note of the grasshopper. It
is one of the most difficult of all the
small birds to collect that I know of.
They are great skulkers. I have often
followed them, guided by their chirping,
in the grass until I was sure the bird
was not more than a few yards away;
then he would suddenly &lsquo;crowd on all
sail&rsquo; and dart away at a high rate of
speed, gyrating from side to side in a
manner that would test the skill of any
collector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nests are described as concealed
in a thick tuft of grass and are rather
deep and cup shaped. They are constructed
of fine grass and fibers.</p>
<p>Though this elegant little Sparrow
baffled bird lovers for so many years,
it is now known to be abundant in many
localities, and it is only because of its
peculiar and retiring habits, living as it
does in grassy places not easily accessible,
that it is not more often observed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<h2 id="c6">EASTER LILIES.</h2>
<p>The one delight of Grace Newton&rsquo;s life
was to visit Aunt Chatty White. Winter
or summer, autumn or spring&mdash;no matter
what the season nor how bright or how
gloomy the weather&mdash;there was sure to
be found some unusually fascinating
pleasure or employment. There were
books of every description with which to
while away the winter days. And in
summer the trees were full of fruit, the
yard with flowers, the fields and garden
with good things, while the birds saucily
claimed possession of all.</p>
<p>But when she was told by Mamma
that she should open Easter with Aunt
Chatty her heart was a-flutter with a joy
not known before. Easter&mdash;her first
away from home! And she was sure that
there would be presents, and new books
to read, and new stories to hear, and rabbits&rsquo;
nests to visit, and&mdash;well, it would
be the gladdest Easter of her life, she
was certain.</p>
<p>It was Good Friday when she arrived
at her aunt&rsquo;s quiet country home. The
winter was dying away and spring was
making itself known and felt, while a
few birds were venturing to sing of summer&rsquo;s
return. The buds were swelling,
the lawns and meadows were becoming
green, and in the woods Grace was sure
she could find, should she try, a violet,
a bloodroot bloom, or a dainty snowdrop.
For these were the first flowers, and
sometimes appeared, her mother told her,
before the snow was fairly gone.</p>
<p>A surprise awaited her, however; for,
as she was wandering aimlessly about the
garden borders that afternoon, she suddenly
came upon a bed of golden buds
and blossoms. After gazing at them a
few moments to make sure she was not
dreaming, she hastened away to Aunt
Chatty for an explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, dearie, those are Easter flowers,&rdquo;
laughed her aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought Easter lilies were
white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not all of them. I have some white
ones&mdash;in another part of the garden.
Those you saw are daffodils and jonquils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John&mdash;who?&rdquo; queried Grace, in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jonquils,&rdquo; repeated Mrs. White,
amused not a little at Grace&rsquo;s ignorance
and wonder. &ldquo;Come! I&rsquo;ll show you
which is which.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grace ran on ahead, and was minutely
inspecting the tender young blossoms
when her aunt arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The large double yellow ones are
daffodils. Those across yonder are the
white ones. Wait!&rdquo; she called, for the
impatient child had already started toward
the bed of more familiar lilies.
&ldquo;Here are the jonquils&mdash;these with cups.
Really the name for these, both the yellow
and the white, is Narcissus. Presently
I&rsquo;ll tell you how they came to have
that name. There are twenty or thirty
kinds, but the most perfect forms grow in
Europe and Japan. Cultivation has done
a great deal for the Narcissus, both in
this and other countries, but these of mine
are but the old-fashioned sort that grandmother
planted here. Now let&rsquo;s go see
the white ones. Will they be in full
bloom for Easter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Grace. &ldquo;See, here are
two now. Mamma has this kind,&rdquo; and
she fondled the snowy blossoms as
though they were friends of long standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are, without doubt, the &lsquo;lilies
of the field&rsquo; that Christ spoke of,&rdquo; said
Aunt Chatty. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it nice of them to
hurry from the ground in the spring in
time to remind us of the resurrection of
Him who commended them so highly?
And their whiteness tells us of His purity,
as though they wish to honor Him as
long as they live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me, aunty, how they came to
have that other name,&rdquo; urged Grace presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. That story was told by the
ancients to frighten boys and girls who
were selfish and unkind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the cosy sitting room they repaired,
for the air had not yet become warm
enough for so lengthy a stay out of
doors. When both were comfortably settled
Aunt Chatty began:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;There was a very beautiful youth,
mythology tells us, who was devotedly
loved by a wood nymph, Echo. But she
had incurred the displeasure of Juno,
their goddess of the heavens, and by her
had been condemned to have the power
to speak only the last word and was forbidden
any other. For this reason she
could not address Narcissus, much as she
desired to do so. When he did speak,
finally, Echo answered by repeating his
last word. Her heart was full of joy,
for she was sure that at last her opportunity
had come. But in spite of her
beauty and purity the youth repelled her,
and left her to haunt the recesses of the
woods. In her disappointment she pined
for him until her form faded because of
grief. Her bones were changed to rocks
and there was nothing left but her voice.
With that she is still ready to reply to
anyone who calls to her and keeps up her
old habit of having the last word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Narcissus was cruel not in this case
alone. He shunned every one else as he
had done poor Echo. One day one of
those whom he repelled so heartlessly
breathed a prayer that he should some
day feel what it was to receive no return
of affection. The wish was granted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a fountain, with water like
silver, to which the shepherds never drove
their flocks. In fact, nothing ever disturbed
its water, and here one day Narcissus
chanced to stop to drink. He saw
his own likeness in the water and, thinking
it a beautiful water spirit living in
the fountain, admired and loved it. He
talked to it, but it would not answer; he
tried to catch it, but it fled whenever he
touched the water. He could not tear
himself away from the spot, for he was
so captivated by the lovely face in the
fountain that he ignored all else. So
there he stayed until he lost his color, his
vigor, and the beauty which had so
charmed Echo. She kept near him, however,
and when, in his grief, he exclaimed,
&lsquo;Alas! alas!&rsquo; she answered with the same
words. He pined away and died. The
nymphs prepared a funeral pile and
would have burned the body, but it was
nowhere to be found; in its place was a
flower, purple within and surrounded
with white leaves, which bears the name
and preserves the memory of Narcissus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Aunt Chatty had finished, Grace,
after gazing out at the white Easter lilies
a few moments, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like the story, but I don&rsquo;t like Narcissus.
He was too selfish and ungrateful.
I like the story best that you told
me in the garden, the one about the &lsquo;lilies
of the field.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c8">THE NORTHERN PHALAROPE.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Phalaropus lobatus.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The Northern Phalarope has a wide
range, extending throughout the northern
portion of the Northern Hemisphere
and in winter reaching the tropics. It
breeds only in Arctic latitudes. It is a
bird of the ocean, and seldom is observed
inland except as a rare migrant early in
May or in October. Then it &ldquo;frequents
slow streams or marshy pools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Phalarope belongs to the shore
birds and to a family that contains but
three known species. Two of these are
sea birds. The other, Wilson&rsquo;s phalarope,
is an inhabitant of the interior of
North America. Their feet are webbed,
and usually the two marine forms, or sea
snipe, as they are sometimes called, migrate
in flocks far from land. Mr. Chapman
says: &ldquo;I have seen it in great numbers
about one hundred miles off Barnegat,
New Jersey, in May. For several
hours the steamer passed through flocks,
which were swimming on the ocean. They
arose in a body at our approach, and
in close rank whirled away to the right
or left in search of new feeding grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not an exaggeration to say that
it is one of the most beautiful of our
aquatic birds. All its motions are graceful.
It possesses a quiet dignity and
elegance while swimming in search of
food, which it frequently obtains by
thrusting its bill into the water. In this
manner it obtains a large number of
marine animals and flies that may be
on the surface of the water. When on
the shore it may be seen wading and
swimming in ponds near the coast.</p>
<p>Dr. Coues wrote in an interesting manner
of this bird. He said that the Northern
Phalarope is &ldquo;a curious compound of
a wader and swimmer. Take one of our
common little sandpipers, fit it for sea
by making oars of its feet, and launch
it upon the great deep, you have a Northern
Phalarope. You may see a flotilla
of these little animated cockle-boats riding
lightly on the waves anywhere off
the coast of New England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Its habits at the mating season are
most interesting, and no words can better
describe them than those of Mr. E. W.
Nelson: &ldquo;As the season comes on when
the flames of love mount high, the dull-colored
male moves about the pool, apparently
heedless of the surrounding fair
ones. Such stoical indifference usually
appears too much for the feelings of
some of the fair ones to bear. A female
coyly glides close to him and bows her
head in pretty submissiveness, but he
turns away, pecks at a bit of food and
moves off; she follows and he quickens
his speed, but in vain; he is her choice,
and she proudly arches her neck and in
mazy circles passes and repasses close
before the harassed bachelor. He turns
his breast first to one side, then to the
other, as though to escape, but there is
his gentle wooer ever pressing her suit
before him. Frequently he takes flight
to another part of the pool, all to no
purpose. If with affected indifference
he tries to feed she swims along side by
side, almost touching him, and at intervals
rises on wing above him and,
poised a foot or two over his back,
makes a half dozen quick, sharp wing-strokes,
producing a series of sharp,
whistling noises in rapid succession. In
the course of time it is said that water
will wear the hardest rock, and it is
certain that time and importunity have
their full effect upon the male of this
Phalarope, and soon all are comfortably
married, while mater familias no longer
needs to use her seductive ways and
charming blandishments to draw his notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then after the four dark and heavily
marked eggs are laid the &ldquo;captive male
is introduced to new duties, and spends
half his time on the eggs, while the female
keeps about the pool close by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These birds, which possess such
dainty elegance in all their motions, do
not exhibit a corresponding degree of
taste in home building. Their nests, at
best, consist of only a few blades of
grass and fragments of moss laid loosely
together. Often the eggs are laid
in some convenient hollow, with no bedding
whatever except that which happened
to lodge there.</p>
<p>These are a few of the facts in the
life history of this bird, which starts in
its career as a little ball of buff and
brown and later in life &ldquo;glides hither
and thither on the water, apparently
drifted by its fancy, and skims about the
pool like an autumn leaf wafted before
the playful zephyrs on some embosomed
lakelet in the forest.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c10">A CARGO OF STOWAWAYS.</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Birds of ocean and of air</p>
<p class="t0">Hither in a troop repair.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">&mdash;<span class="sc">Aristophanes&rsquo;</span> &ldquo;The Birds.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Passing out of the golden sunrise into
a world of blue sky and the blue waters
of Lake Huron, we regretfully assured
ourselves that save for the shadowy gray
and white gulls that followed in the wake
of our steamer in search of a breakfast,
there would be for us no bird reviews
so dear to the heart of the ornithologist
in a strange country, or not at least until
we should have reached the far distant
islands in the picturesque River Sault
Ste. Mary, so with the inertia of the
blank waters about us we prepared to be
content, but in this instance, as in many
others, we were to learn that conclusions
are by no means conclusive, and it was
with joy that we could exclaim with
Aristophanes:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;But hark! the rushing sound of rushing wings</p>
<p class="t0">Approaches us,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>when before our delighted and surprised
eyes alighted a bronze grackle, most majestic
of blackbirds, who stepped off
across the deck with all of the pride of a
lately promoted major, doubtless glad
enough to find himself on solid footing
after the heavy gale of the past night,
which has blown him into unknown seas.
His rich metallic plumage gleamed in
the sunlight as he eyed us inquisitively,
the while walking calmly about us picking
up the insects of which we seemed to
have an abundant supply aboard. But
where is the little wife to whom he
was so devoted, and whose labors of
incubation he so materially assisted, taking
his &ldquo;turn&rdquo; on the nest with clock-like
regularity? But also he shared with
her their rich song notes which so delight
us during the courting season.
But our grackle is by no means the
only stowaway we were to carry north
with us, for all at once the air was
resonant with excited &ldquo;chips&rdquo; and
&ldquo;zeeps&rdquo; as the different winged passengers
arrived. At least half a dozen pine
warblers contentedly flitted onto the
deck, filling the air with their sweet
calls, and dancing about like little balls
of yellow feathers. And to delight beyond
anything the heart of a bird enthusiast,
far more indeed than can any
result of gun, camera or opera glass,
was the fact that exhaustion and hunger
had entirely obliterated from these
birds every trace of their dread of the
human kind, and they associated with
us as fearlessly as tho&rsquo; to the manor
born. Particularly was this true of the
pine warblers who hopped about us on
the hatchways like chickens, one venturesome
little fellow even becoming so familiar
as to alight on the toe of my slipper,
and quietly inspect its steel embroidery
with silent curiosity, occasionally
glancing up at me out of his round,
bright eyes as confidentially as though
he was a connoisseur in footwear. Another
warbler lit on the corner of a book
that one of the passengers was holding
in her hand. This rare friendliness made
us feel that we had not only the bird
in the hand, but also the two in the
bush, with still a balance in our favor,
for we could study their movements as
intimately as we desired, but I could
hardly keep from rubbing my eyes in
amazement, fearing &ldquo;&rsquo;twas but a dream,&rdquo;
or that my brain has been turned, as
topsy turvy this morning as was my
stomach the night before. But the experience
was certainly uniquely delightful
to say the least. After all of these
years of careful peeking and prying to
secure a moment&rsquo;s observation of some
of these birds, to have them now flitting
about me, at my very feet as it
were, in this familiar and friendly fashion
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
was indeed a rare treat. It is
Darwin who has said that he had come
to the conclusion that the wildness of
birds with regard to man is a particular
instinct directed against him, and
not dependent on any general degree of
caution arising from other sources of
danger. Birds in general, however, have
had reason to become timid from their
experience of the human biped, and hold
with Eben Holden that &ldquo;Men are the
most terrible of all critters, an&rsquo; the
meanest. They&rsquo;re the only critters that
kill fer fun,&rdquo; and it has become instinctive
for them to act accordingly.</p>
<p>However, we had not yet arrived at
the end of our experience with the sociable
bird world, for it seemed that we were
to carry a full cargo of stowaways, for
the next arrivals were six or seven
juncos savoring of frost and wintry
weather, notwithstanding the heat of the
autumnal sun. Miss Merriam has quaintly
styled these busy little birds: &ldquo;Gray
robed monks and nuns,&rdquo; though their
character does not cleverly carry out that
conception, for they are a pugnacious
lot of feathers and blood, and there were
pitch battles going on at every hatch
corner, the juncos playing the part of
the aggressor every time, turning and
conspicuously flaunting their stylish
white tail markings in the face of their
opponents. The next advent was that of
a tiny house wren, who seemed to have
had a good deal of his natural belligerency
blown out of him, and was content
to make a peaceful breakfast on the Canada
soldiers that were swarming about.
Wrens are noticeable for the interest
that they take in human belongings, and
love to make their home among them. At
Marquette I was shown a nest built in
an overshoe inadvertently left in the
crotch of an apple tree, and which, I am
glad to report, the owner left undisturbed
when she learned by whom it was pre-empted.
I thought of our little stowaway
when I saw the nest and wondered how
much he could have told me of its construction.
Some one has mentioned a
nest built in an old coat sleeve, and Audubon
tells us of a pair that nested in
his parlor, paying him rent in song
music. The wren has also received
much &ldquo;honorable mention&rdquo; in history,
Aristotle being the first, I believe, to call
him the King of Birds, possibly because
of the legend that tells us that to gain
his sovereignty in a trial of flight he concealed
himself on the back of an eagle
who was one of the contestants, and
after that bird of mighty wing power
had reached his limit the wren, arising
from his seat among the eagle&rsquo;s feathers,
easily flew much higher, thus gaining the
race and title. Perhaps not the first time
that high places have been arrived at
through duplicity. But, in justice to his
species, mention should be made of the
myth that asserts that in ye golden time
the wren was the only bird brave enough
to enter heaven and bring down fire to
earth for the benefit of the mortals. In
this philanthropical work he scorched off
his feathers, so the other birds made a
donation party and each contributed some
spare feathers to the singed benefactor
(but we notice that their generosity, like
that of some others, was confined to donating
their plainest apparel), all but the
owl, who refused to part with a single
quill, but who for his stinginess was at
once ostracised from good society, and
forced to make his appearance only after
nightfall, when the &ldquo;best people&rdquo; were
not in evidence.</p>
<p>Of the two other members of the warbler
family, who traveled north with us
singly and alone, one was a Blackburnian
warbler, silent and dull of plumage as
befitted the season, and the other a dainty
black-throated blue warbler, one of the
most dressy and gentlemanly appearing
birds of the warbler species. In his steely
blue coat, black stock and evening vest
and wide expanse of white shirt front,
he looks as though fully attired for a
swell reception. His two white wing
patches closely resemble handkerchiefs
peeping from side pockets, completing
the illusion. He was rather more reserved
in his movements than the gang
of noisy associates, and picked daintily
at the flies as befits well-bred superiority.
But he, like the rest, showed no apparent
distrust of us, neither did some newly
arrived white-throated sparrows, who
joined in the general scramble for insects.
But not now do we hear their
cheerful &ldquo;I-have-got-plenty-to-eat-but-no-che-eze,&rdquo;
as Dr. Brewer interprets
their song. I am sure that they could
have had cheese or anything else they
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
desired on board the Castalia, for on
hospitable thoughts intent I secured some
crumbs from the table, but my feathered
fellow travelers would have none of me,
passing my humble offerings by in disdain.
There was but one death on the
passage, and that was a white-eyed
vireo, who either succumbed to exhaustion
or struck the rigging too violently
in boarding the steamer.</p>
<p>But birds were not the only winged
creatures who took passage with us. For
several hours a continuous stream of
honey bees and yellow-jackets flew exhausted
upon the deck, only to become
food for the bee-eating passengers. The
few who escaped and revived sufficiently
to crawl up onto the cabin were so fatigued
that one could stroke them
gently without provoking any antagonism.
Wafted across the blue
waters by adverse winds came also
myriads of common yellow butterflies,
tossing in the gentle breeze like
handfuls of shining buttercups, and
great troops of beautiful milkweed butterflies
(Anosia plexippus), their brilliant
colors gleaming in the sunlight in all the
richness of ebony and crimson. They
hovered about the steamer like gorgeous
blossoms cut from the parent stalk and
left poised in mid air at the mercy of
treacherous gales. Funny little atoms of
vanity and brightness, whose homes are
among the gardens of peace and sunshine,
what business had they here in this
region of seething waters and tempestuous
winds?</p>
<p>We looked to have our feathered
friends leave us upon the first appearance
of land, but, on the contrary, they
remained with us all of the afternoon,
as we sailed in and out among the picturesque
islands of the &ldquo;Soo&rdquo; river, and
it was not until toward their bed-time
and the setting of the sun that they gradually
began to disappear; the last to
leave, and that was at dusk, was the
black-throated blue warbler. Just before
reaching the lock a couple of juncos
perched on the rail and engaged in what
seemed to us a very heated discussion,
until finally one of them, with a chip of
command, flew to the shore, the other
following in a moment with a note of
protest. The latter&rsquo;s idea doubtless was
to remain with a good thing in hand
rather than venture into pastures new
of unknown possibilities.</p>
<p>On our return trip, the weather being
calm, no birds were:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Buffeted and baffled, with the gusty gale,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>hence our only stowaways were a couple
of yellow warblers, who spent most of
their time in one of the offices catching
flies on the wall, and we were obliged
to resort to other resources for our entertainment,
and found at least artistic
as well as botanical enjoyment in looking
at the great bunches of golden rod,
yellow cone flowers and pale primroses,
a combination of yellows that formed an
exquisite blend, and which covered the
embankment of the great willow dike on
St. Clair Flats, that seems fast running
into a state of dilapidation and decay.
But it is a delightful sail down the willow-bordered
lane of blue water, a stray
bit of Venice with Venice left out, as it
were, and where no angry waters toss
the brave mariner and consequently seasick
traveler across mighty billows, a
performance which is a by no means
charming accessory to one&rsquo;s erstwhile
home on the bounding deep.</p>

</div>
<p>The geographical and the breeding
ranges of the Hairy Woodpecker are
practically the same. These include
eastern North America from the southern
provinces of Canada southward to
the States bordering the Gulf of Mexico
and those of the southeastern United
States bordering the Atlantic Ocean. In
these States it is occasionally found during
the winter season. Westward its
range extends to the Rocky Mountains.
It is, however, most abundant in the
forest areas of the Northern and Middle
States, where, as it is a hardy bird and
not greatly affected by extreme cold,
it is generally a constant resident.
Though occasionally found in old orchards,
its choice feeding grounds are
the timbered regions of river banks and
other bodies of water. Here and in the
trees at the outer borders of forests it
seeks its food by itself, for it has an unsocial
disposition, and it is seldom that
more than a pair are seen together. &ldquo;It
does not live in harmony with smaller
species of its own kind, and drives them
away when they encroach on its feeding
grounds, being exceedingly greedy in
disposition and always hungry.&rdquo; It also
is not adverse to a home in the deeper
forests and may even frequent clumps
of trees in the open.</p>
<p>The Hairy Woodpecker is one of the
most useful and valuable friends of
human interests. Not only does it feed
upon the larv&aelig; that burrow in the wood
and bark of our forest and orchard trees,
but also upon beetles and other insects.
It is only in the winter season, when its
natural food is not readily obtained, that
it gathers seeds and fruits. It never attacks
a sound tree for any purpose, and
the loss caused by the amount of useful
grain destroyed is greatly overbalanced
by the good that it does in the
destruction of noxious insects.</p>
<p>The value of this shy and retiring
bird is well illustrated by Mr. V. A.
Alderson, who says in the &ldquo;Oologist&rdquo;
(July, 1890): &ldquo;Last summer potato
bugs covered every patch of potatoes in
Marathon County, Wisconsin. One of
my friends here found his patch an exception,
and, therefore, took pains to
find out the reason, and observed a
Hairy Woodpecker making frequent
visits to the potato field and going from
there to a large pine stub a little distance
away. After observing this for
about six weeks, he made a visit to the
pine stub, and found, on inspection, a
large hole in its side, almost fifteen feet
up. He took his ax and cut down the
stub, split it open, and found inside over
two bushels of bugs. All had their
heads off and bodies intact. Now, why
did the Woodpecker carry the bugs
whole to the tree and only bite off and
eat the heads, which could have been
done in the open field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hairy Woodpecker has no leisure
moments. He is always active and</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The little tap of busy bill</p>
<p class="t0">The signal of his work and skill.</p>
</div>
<p>is ever present</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">To rid the soil of every foe,</p>
<p class="t">To guard the leafy trees.</p>
</div>
<p>The movements of this Woodpecker
are interesting, for, like its sister species,
it moves with equal facility either upwards
or downwards, sidewise or backwards
upon a tree trunk. From time to
time it will stop and seem to listen, and,
finally bracing itself with the stiff feathers
of its spiney tail, it will deliver powerful
blows with its chisel-like bill at
some point that will be likely to furnish
a dainty morsel of food. There is little
doubt that its sense of hearing is very
acute and that it can detect the slightest
movement of an insect in the bark
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
or wood of a tree that to other animals
would be imperceptible.</p>
<p>The flight of the Hairy Woodpecker is
like that of the other species of its group.
It is wavering and undulating, seldom
protracted and usually consisting of a
number of short vibrations of the wings.
When alighting, they grasp the object
with both feet simultaneously. This
Woodpecker is the earliest of all the
family to build its nest. Mating begins
in the latter part of March, and at this
time the birds are exceedingly noisy.
The male when not feeding will resort
to some dead limb and vigorously drum
and &ldquo;the louder the noise produced, the
more satisfactory it appears to be to the
performer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regarding the building of the nest,
Major Bendire says: &ldquo;Both sexes take
part in the labor, and it is really wonderful
how neat and smooth an excavation
these birds can make with their
chisel-shaped bills in a comparatively
short time. The entrance hole is round,
as if made with an auger, about two
inches in diameter, and just large enough
to admit the body of the bird; the edges
are nicely beveled, the inside is equally
smooth, and the cavity is gradually enlarged
toward the bottom. The entrance
hole, which is not unfrequently placed
under a limb for protection from the
weather, generally runs in straight
through the solid wood for about three
inches, and then downward from ten to
eighteen inches, and some of the finer
chips are allowed to remain on the bottom
of the cavity, in which the eggs
are deposited. Both dead and living
trees are selected for nesting sites, generally
the former. When living trees
are chosen, the inner core, or heart of
the tree, is usually more or less decayed.
These nesting sites are nearly always
selected with such good judgment that
such obstacles as hard knots are rarely
encountered; should this occur, the site
is abandoned and a fresh one selected.&rdquo;
The male, after the work is completed,
will often excavate one or more holes
in the same tree in order that he may
have a resting place at night near to
his mate.</p>
<h2 id="c12">A VARICOLORED FROG.</h2>
<p>An amateur naturalist, amid the ordinary
organic forms that he may encounter
in his own country, is often grievously
puzzled at curious specimens of
animal life that may be brought under
his attention. But amid the illimitable
animal life of the wild region of the upper
Orinoco even the most expert and
learned naturalist will often find himself
&ldquo;stumped&rdquo; by the many unusual and
hitherto undiscovered things that occasionally
beset his pathway.</p>
<p>Among the many curious and quaint
animal specimens encountered by the
writer in this region was an arboreal frog
of startlingly beautiful colorings. This
little creature rested upon a stomach of
orange flame hue, while the head and
back were marked with velvet purple
tints, and a narrow snow-white stripe
extended from the point of his nose to
the tip of a tiny tail. With such brilliant
colorings it is easily and distinctly observed,
but the snakes, weasels and other
arch enemies of the amphibians have no
relish for this handsome specimen. Its
weapon of defense against its would-be
enemies is a sweat venom of a most nauseous
odor, which it emits when any one
approaches it. This venom is common
among the toads, and the fact is referred
to by Juvenal (Dryden&rsquo;s translation) of
the lady &ldquo;who squeezed a toad into her
husband&rsquo;s wine.&rdquo; It is probable that the
beautiful frog of so many glaring colors
would have long since been exterminated
by its many enemies and persecutors
but for the poisonous and nauseous
fluid ejected from its glands.</p>

<h2 id="c13">WAS IT REASON OR INSTINCT?</h2>
<p>Old Boney is a large shaggy dog of a
deep tan color, and a general favorite
among the people in the quarter of the
city in which he lives, while he is honored
and respected by every member of the
canine race for miles around. Especially
are the little children fond of him; and
it seems to be as much a pastime for him
as for his young playmates to carry the
boys and girls on his broad back, their
little, chubby hands buried in his long,
matted hair in their half-frightened efforts
to keep from slipping off and tumbling
upon the ground.</p>
<p>His owner&rsquo;s daughter, a young girl
just entering her teens, attends the high
school, about three blocks from her home,
which is reached by rather a circuitous
route. Boney had often accompanied his
young mistress to the school and was familiar
with the way thither as well as
with the main entrance and winding stairway
of the building.</p>
<p>It was in the showery month of April,
and Etta had repeatedly neglected to wear
her rubbers when she started for school
in the morning, a fault for which she had
often been reprimanded.</p>
<p>Now it happened one warm afternoon
that a copious shower came down in due
April style. The door leading from the
dining room out upon the veranda was
wide ajar, and Etta&rsquo;s mother, looking out,
saw her daughter&rsquo;s rubbers upon the veranda
floor near the rug where they were
usually deposited when not in use.
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; exclaimed the mother, &ldquo;that
child has gone again without her rubbers
and will come home with wet feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sharp remark aroused the attention
of old Boney, for he got up from his
prone condition on the rug, looked at the
speaker, sniffed at the rubbers and lay
down again. At this juncture Etta&rsquo;s father
quietly picked up the rubbers, carried
them over to the school building and
handed them to his daughter, whom he
met at the upper landing of the stairway.
This had been done more than once,
Boney generally lying upon the veranda
floor where he could easily hear and see
what was being done on such occasions,
and he had often followed his master
and stood by when father and daughter
met at the school building.</p>
<p>Now comes the interesting part of our
story. A drenching shower came down
about three o&rsquo;clock one afternoon and
Etta had, as usual, neglected to take her
needed footwear. It happened this time
that none of the family was at home.
Boney, however, was keeping house in
his accustomed place on the rug. Now,
what do our readers think the noble animal
did. Why, he just picked up both
of the rubbers, carried them in his mouth
through the driving rain to the school
building, up the winding stairway and
laid them upon the landing. As if this
were not enough, he lay down and faithfully
watched his charge till Etta made
her appearance, when he politely dropped
her property at her feet.</p>
<p>Thereafter Etta&rsquo;s father was relieved
of this service, Boney regularly attending
to the business himself, and, what is more
wonderful still, he never attempted to
discharge his duty on a pleasant day.</p>
<p>Query. Was this reason or instinct?
If the latter, what is instinct?</p>

<h2 id="c14">OPAL.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The Opal, when pure and uncut in
its native rock,&rdquo; says Ruskin in his lecture
on Color, &ldquo;presents the most lovely
colors that can be seen in the world
except those of clouds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While not all of us may share the
great art critic&rsquo;s preference for uncut
stones, there are few probably who will
not join him heartily in his admiration
of the brilliant gem from whose
depths come welling up tints of so
varied hue that we appropriately speak
of them as colors at play. Our interest
in these colors may be heightened
by reading what Ruskin has further to
say of them: &ldquo;We have thus in nature,
chiefly obtained by crystalline conditions,
a series of groups of entirely
delicious hues; and it is one of the best
signs that the bodily system is in a
healthy state when we can see these
clearly in their most delicate tints and
enjoy them fully and simply with the
kind of enjoyment that children have
in eating sweet things. I shall place
a piece of rock opal on the table in your
working room; and if on fine days you
will sometimes dip it in water, take it
into sunshine and examine it with a
lens of moderate power, you may always
test your progress in sensibility to
color by the degree of pleasure it gives
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Opal is indeed one of the most
fascinating of gems; yet often elusive
and at times disappointing. Of its freaks
and foibles strange stories are told.
Gems of brilliant quality are known suddenly
to have lost their hues never to
regain them, while others previously dull
and lusterless have become radiant as
the rainbow.</p>
<p>Prof. Egleston, of New York city, relates
that a bottle of cut Opals once
given him by a prominent jewelry firm
because they had lost their color, after
remaining in his cabinet for a time regained
their brilliancy and retained it.
But to have opals regain their color is,
unfortunately, far less usual than
for them to lose it. The gem often exhibits
brilliant colors when wet either
with water or oil that disappear when
it is dry. Taking advantage of this peculiarity
dishonest dealers often keep
opals immersed until just before offering
them for sale. The experience of
having stones so treated as well as others
which might with more reason be
expected to retain their brilliancy, lose
it, has very likely led to the superstition
commonly attached to the Opal that it is
an unlucky gem. Some authorities, however,
trace the origin of the superstition
to Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s novel, &ldquo;Anne
of Geierstein,&rdquo; in which the baleful influence
of the Opal plays a prominent
part, and it is stated that within a year
of the publication of the book the price
of Opals declined fifty per cent in the
European market. Even if the superstition
did not originate in either of
these ways it was probably from a source
quite as trivial and it should prevent no
one from enjoying the pleasure to be
derived from the beauties of this gem.</p>
<p>Chemically, Opal is oxide of silicon
with varying amounts of water, the
water varying from 3 to 9 per cent. It
is, therefore, closely allied to quartz, but
differs physically in being softer and
not as heavy. Further, it never crystallizes,
and it is soluble in caustic potash,
which quartz is not. It is infusible, but
cracks and becomes opaque before the
blowpipe. In sulphuric acid it turns
black, on account probably of the organic
matter it contains.</p>
<p>Its hardness is sometimes as low as
5.5 in the scale in which quartz is 7
and its specific gravity is from 1.9 to
2.3, while that of quartz is 2.6. On account
of its relative softness a cut Opal
often does not retain its polish well and
requires frequent smoothing. Opals when
first taken from the ground are often
softer even than the above and for this
reason it is usual and desirable to allow
them to harden or &ldquo;season,&rdquo; as it is
called, for some time after quarrying,
before they are polished.</p>

<p>Opal as a mineral is quite common, so
that no one need suppose because he
has specimens labeled &ldquo;opal&rdquo; in his collection
that he has as many precious
stones. It occurs in many varieties, and,
especially if it contains foreign matter,
in many colors. Nearly all silica deposited
by hot waters is in the form of
Opal, so that the geysers of Yellowstone
Park build up cones of Opal and fall
into Opal basins. This particular form
of Opal is known as geyserite, and it
is often differently colored by different
ingredients.</p>
<p>Wood is often preserved by silica in
the form of Opal, the siliceous waters
taking away the wood and replacing it
by Opal, grain by grain, with such delicacy
and accuracy that the structure of
the wood is perfectly maintained. The
minute shells which diatoms make consist
of Opal, and when these dead shells
accumulate to form deposits of some extent
we call the powdery substance tripoli
and use it for polishing silverware
and other metals. Then there are
hyalite, a variety of Opal looking like
transfixed water, so clear and colorless is
it; hydrophane, a translucent variety
which sticks to the tongue and becomes
more nearly transparent when soaked in
water; cacholong, a porcelain-like variety,
and menilite, a concretionary variety.</p>
<p>Common Opal varies from transparent
to opaque, being most often translucent
and sometimes exhibiting the
peculiar milkiness of color which we
call opalescence. It has sometimes a
glassy, but often a waxy luster, the latter
when pronounced giving rise to the varieties
known as wax Opal and resin
Opal. When Opal has the banded structure
of agate it is known as Opal-agate;
when it has the color of jasper as jasper
Opal, and when that of chrysoprase as
prase Opal. But none of these varieties
are used in any quantity as gems. This
distinction is reserved almost wholly for
the variety known as noble or precious
Opal. This is Opal which exhibits a
play of colors. No essential chemical
or physical distinction between noble
Opal and other varieties is known. In
a large vein of Opal portions will exhibit
the play of colors and the remainder
will not, but why the difference
has not yet been determined. Neither
can the origin of the varied coloring;
i. e., the iridescence, be determined.
Some regard it as due to interspersed
layers containing different percentages of
water, which break up the rays of light
somewhat as a prism does, while others
think that minute cracks and fissures
through the stone furnish surfaces from
which the rays are reflected in different
colors back to the eye. Some Opals
which are dull and lusterless when dry
exhibit considerable play of color when
immersed in water, and this fact seems
to favor the first theory of the cause of
the iridescence, but the subject is not
understood. The character of the play
of colors differs in different Opals, and
this gives rise to different varieties. The
true noble Opal has the color quite uniformly
distributed. When the color appears
in flashes of red, yellow, etc., the
stone is known as fire Opal; if blue as
girasol, and if chiefly yellow as golden
Opal. When the patches of color are
small, angular and uniformly distributed
it is called harlequin Opal, and if these
are long and somewhat parallel, flame
Opal. These colors are not, of course,
inherent in the stone, its color varying
from colorless to opaque white.
The black Opals sometimes seen and
highly prized by some are usually artificial,
and are made by soaking ordinary
Opals in oil and then burning oil on
them. The brilliancy of the stone is
thus increased, but it is usually fragile
and liable to lose color.</p>
<p>Any Opal will lose its play of colors
on being heated too highly, hence possessors
should avoid subjecting them to
more than ordinary heat. It is the variety
and brilliancy of their changing
colors which give to Opal nearly all its
desirability as a precious stone, for, as
has often been remarked, the qualities
of hardness, transparency and rich body
color which give to most other gems
their value are lacking in the Opal. But
together with the beauty of its changing
colors Opal possesses an advantage
over all other gems in that it cannot
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
be successfully imitated. It is said that
the Romans were able to make artificial
Opals closely resembling the real, but,
if so, the art has been lost never to be
recovered, and we may hope it never
will be. Hence, however much danger
there may be in buying an Opal that it
has not been properly &ldquo;seasoned,&rdquo; or
may not retain its color, the purchaser
may at least be sure he has an Opal and
not an imitation. The stones are usually
cut in the oval form known as en cabouchon,
this cutting being found to
bring out their brilliancy better than any
facetted form. The brilliancy of the
stone may be increased in setting by giving
it a backing of mother of pearl or
black silk. When a number of Opals
are placed together they seem to borrow
brilliancy from one another, a fact
which is taken advantage of in settings
by placing a number together and also
by Opal dealers to dispose of inferior
stones by grouping them with good ones.
For this reason when Opals are purchased
they should be examined separately.
The value of Opals depends almost
wholly on the brilliancy of their
coloring and their size. Stones without
the play of colors are practically worthless,
while stones of ten to twenty
carats&rsquo; weight, with brilliant coloring,
may bring several hundred dollars. The
most highly valued Opals have long come
from the mines of Czernowitza in northern
Hungary. These Opals are often
known as Oriental Opals from the fact
that in early days they were first purchased
by Greek and Turkish merchants,
and by them sent to Holland.
There are, however, no localities in the
Orient where precious Opals are found.
The rock in which the Hungarian Opals
occur is eruptive, and of the kind known
as andesite. It is considerably decomposed,
and the Opal occurs in clefts and
veins. There is little doubt that it was
from these mines that the Romans obtained
the Opals known to them, and
the output has been quite constant since.</p>
<p>It is said that the Hungarian Opals are
less likely to deteriorate than any others.
Still the danger of deterioration is not
great in any Opal. The other important
countries from which precious Opals are
obtained are Mexico, Honduras and Australia.
The Mexican Opals are mostly
of the fire Opal variety. They are
mined in a number of the States of the
Republic&mdash;Queretaro, Hidalgo, Guerrero,
Michoacan, Jalisco and San Luis Potosi.
The oldest mines are in the State of
Hidalgo, near Zimapan, where the Opal
occurs in a red trachyte. Most of the
Mexican Opals on the market at the
present time, however, come from the
State of Queretaro, where mining for
them is conducted on a more extensive
scale. The Opal here occurs in long
veins in a porphyritic trachyte, and is
mined at various points. The stones are
cut and polished by workmen in the city
of Queretaro who use ordinary grind-stones
and chamois skins for the work
and are said to receive an average wage
of 23 cents a day.</p>
<p>The Honduras Opals reach foreign
markets but rarely and usually uncut.
The mines are in the western part of
Honduras, in the Department of Gracias.
They are little worked, but there is no
doubt that extensive deposits exist which
might afford a good supply of gems if
they were properly exploited. The Australian
Opals come from several localities,
the most prominent at the present
time being White Cliffs, New South
Wales. The matrix is a Cretaceous
sandstone which has been permeated by
hot volcanic waters. Shells, bones and
other fossils are found here entirely
altered to precious Opal, making objects
of great beauty. In 1899 Opals to the
value of $650,000 were sold from this
single region. There is no doubt that
the present popularity of the Opal is
due to some extent to the supply of
beautiful stones which has come from
these mines at prices at from one-third
to one-tenth those of the Hungarian
stones. Other localities in Australia
whence precious Opals are obtained are
places on the Barcoo River and Bulla
Creek, Queensland, and occasional finds
in West Australia.</p>
<p>No localities in the United States
yielding precious Opals in any quantity
have yet been discovered. Some good
stones have been cut from an occurrence
in Idaho, and some other minor
finds have been made, but they possess
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
little commercial importance at present.</p>
<p>Opal does not seem to have been extensively
known or used by the ancients,
although we know the Romans prized
it highly and ascribed to it the power of
warning against disaster. The Roman
Senator Nonius owned one set in a ring
which was said to be valued at nearly a
million dollars. History records that for
refusing to sell the stone to Mark Antony
he was sent into exile. The next
most famous Opal in history is one
owned by the Empress Josephine which
was called &ldquo;The Burning of Troy,&rdquo; on
account of the brilliancy of the flames
which shot forth from its depths. The
present whereabouts of neither of these
gems is known. A large Mexican Opal,
now in the Field Columbian Museum, is
carved in the image of the Mexican sun-god,
and has a setting of gold representing
the diverging rays of the sun. This
gem is very ancient and is believed to
have been kept by the Aztecs in a temple,
so it is probable that the Aztecs
knew and prized Opals.</p>
<p>The Arabians believe that Opals fall
from heaven with the lightning&rsquo;s flash,
a beautiful fancy, indeed. Modern usage
makes the Opal the birthstone of the
month of October, some of the properties
assigned to it being that it has the
power of making its wearer a general
favorite, enhancing the keenness of his
sight and shielding him from suicide.</p>

<br />(Ovis aries.)

<h2 id="c17">THE DOMESTIC SHEEP.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Ovis aries.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>It was a little strip of fur which
adorned a lady&rsquo;s cloak. It was soft and
warm and black and curly. The lady
called it astrakhan, but the sheep, whose
lamb met an early death that its pleasing
fine coat might become the covering of
someone in far away America, still lives
on the steppes of the Far East. Her
master and herder belong to one of the
wandering tribes which roam about Central
Asia. Had the lamb lived to maturity
its beautiful fine coat would have
changed to coarse hair, very unlike the
wool of the sheep we find in America.
It would have grown to a large size; it
would have had short horns, a very
short, flat tail, with great bunches of fat
on the haunches at either side.</p>
<p>There would have been among its companions
some sheep entirely white; others
white with black heads; but in its
immediate family all would have been
black throughout.</p>
<p>Imagine the little lamb taking the
journey across the Eastern continent!
Should we follow it in its journey we
would find many interesting varieties of
its kind. In crossing Syria and Asia
Minor we would find the curious, flat-tailed
sheep; their tails are most remarkable
to one unaccustomed to the
sight, for they are long masses of fat,
sometimes weighing forty or fifty
pounds, and often trailing upon the
ground. In this case they are frequently
supported by little sledges to relieve the
animal of its burden. It seems impossible
to understand why these tails
should grow to this inconvenient and
enormous length, when other breeds near
by have practically no tails at all.</p>
<p>Leaving the country of the broad-tailed
sheep and passing along the south
of Europe, we find in Spain a very important
and interesting variety, the Merino
sheep. While in the mountains of
Spain they are found in the greatest perfection,
the breed has spread over many
parts of Europe and has been introduced
into South Africa, America and Australia.
It is noted for the fineness of its
wool and is considered by many to be
the most profitable of all sheep.</p>
<p>For some reason the Merino sheep has
not found favor in the British isles, but
we find there many other well known
round-tailed varieties.</p>
<p>The Shetland and Orkney breeds have
in their fleece soft, fine wool, largely intermixed
with hair. They are of small
size and horns may be found on both
sexes, although they may be lacking in
the ewes.</p>
<p>The soft-wooled sheep of Scotland are
a breed nearly extinct; they have short
horns, lank bodies and short wool.</p>
<p>In Wales we find two races of small
size; one lives in the higher mountains,
is dark in color, has much hair mixed
with soft wool, and horns are found on
both sexes. The other race is without
horns and is covered with a soft wool.
Both varieties are hardy and are noted
for their fine flesh.</p>
<p>The Irish Wicklow sheep were originally
very similar to the Welsh variety.
Among other Irish breeds the Kerry is
best known. It is wild in disposition,
larger than the Welsh sheep, with the
horns frequently absent in the ewes.</p>
<p>The hardiest and boldest of all the
British races are the black-faced Heath
breed; these have dark colored limbs and
faces and coarse and shaggy fleeces.</p>
<p>The Cheviot breed are hornless, with
white limbs and faces; they are heavier
than the Heath breed, but have less endurance.</p>
<p>The old Norfolk breed of the east of
England are strong and active, with
horns, which are thick and spiral in the
rams; the body and limbs are long, the
face and legs black, and the silky wool
is of medium length.</p>
<p>The Dartmoor and Exmoor sheep are
&ldquo;the breeds of the older forests, commons
and chases.&rdquo; They are of small
size, may or may not have horns, have
dark or gray faces and have wool of medium
length.</p>
<p>The well known Southdowns have no
horns; they have dark brown faces, ears
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
and limbs; the head is always comparatively
small, the lower jaws are thin and
fine and the space between the ears is
well covered with wool.</p>
<p>The Dorset and pink-nosed Somerset
breed are in the southwest of England.
They are known by their long white
limbs and their white faces; the muzzle
is sometimes flesh-colored and the wool
is of medium length.</p>
<p>Then there are the various long-wooled
sheep of which the new Leicester
breed is considered first in respect to
form and ability to fatten readily. Other
long-wooled sheep are the Lincolnshire,
the Romney Marsh, the Cotswold, the
Devonshire, the Notts and the long-wooled
Irish breeds.</p>
<p>There are other breeds less well known
and less important, but the breeds of the
British isles are by no means confined to
that locality. They have been taken to
the United States and to other countries.
In fact, some variety of domestic sheep
can be found in every land, and no animal
is more useful to its owner.</p>
<p>In spite of the various breeds, the
characteristics of all domestic sheep are
similar. They have not the courage and
independence of their cousins, the wild
sheep of the mountains. These delight
to roam to the highest altitudes, some
species being found as high as 22,000
feet above the level of the sea. No other
animal save the musk ox and the mountain
goat can exist at this height. Doubtless
the domestic sheep would thrive better
if it could escape the low levels and
the plains, for, like the wild sheep, it is
a mountain-loving creature. It has
adapted itself to the lower altitude, but
at a great loss of its original characteristics.
It has to an extreme extent become
a dependent animal, unable to care
for itself, totally lacking in courage and
resources, very easily frightened and
without marked character. An entire
flock is easily startled by any unusual
noise; thunder and lightning completely
unsettles them, and human efforts to
quiet them often prove unavailing.</p>
<p>Brehm tells us that &ldquo;on the steppes of
Russia and Asia the shepherds often
have the most arduous tasks in preserving
their charges. During a snowstorm
or thunderstorm the panicstricken flocks
disperse in a wild stampede, rushing out
into the wastes of the steppe like senseless
creatures, and then resignedly suffer
themselves to be snowed under or to
freeze without making any attempt to
shelter themselves from the storm or
even to seek for food.&rdquo; In Russia a goat
is generally used as a leader for a flock
of sheep, but even a goat is not always
able to keep the stupid animals under
proper guidance. During a thunderstorm
they huddle together and cannot
be made to move. &ldquo;If lightning strikes
into the flock,&rdquo; says Lenz, &ldquo;many are
killed at once; if fire breaks out in the
sheepfold the sheep do not run out, but,
on the contrary, sometimes rush into the
fire.&rdquo; The best manner of rescuing sheep
from a burning fold or structure is to let
the sheep dog to which they are accustomed,
drive them out.</p>
<p>To a certain degree, however, the
sheep exhibits mental capacity. It learns
to know its keeper, obeys his call and displays
a certain amount of affection and
docility towards him. It seems to have
a liking for music, or at least it patiently
and passively listens to the bagpipe playing
of the shepherd, and it has evidently
some premonition of impending changes
in the weather.</p>
<p>Sheep thrive best on a diet of various
dried plants. The botanist Linn&aelig;us
states that they &ldquo;feed on three hundred
and twenty-seven of the common Central
European plants, avoiding one hundred
and forty-one. Ranunculus, cypress
spurge, meadow-saffron, shave-grass,
wild cabbage or skunk cabbage and
rushes are poison to it. It is fond of
salt and fresh drinking water is necessary
to its well being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother usually gives birth to but
one lamb, although occasionally there are
more. The little creature must first have
human care, but later they are permitted
to follow their mother, which shows
great affection for her offspring.</p>
<p>A sheep may live to be fourteen years
of age, though at nine or ten years it
will lose most of its teeth and cannot
maintain itself by grazing.</p>

<h2 id="c18">THE BEAUTY OF A STORM.</h2>
<p>The person standing by the window
watching the progress of the storm may
see some of its beauty, but he will miss
the most vital part&mdash;its very spirit.</p>
<p>Perhaps the majority of people looking
out of the window this morning exclaimed,
&ldquo;What a disagreeable day!&rdquo;
And so it might seem to those who remained
indoors; and, alas! also to many
pedestrians who are not attuned to Nature
and who have not yet seen the wisdom
of providing themselves with suitable
attire for stormy weather, instead of
foolishly clinging to the old idea that
&ldquo;anything will do to wear on a rainy
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These very likely were oblivious to the
beauty which surrounded them and failed
to be touched by the spirit of the storm.</p>
<p>To many besides myself, however, I
hope it was a &ldquo;beautiful morning.&rdquo; When
I started forth to walk the wind, which
was quite strong, was blowing in fitful
gusts, while the rain fell heavily, in spite
of which state of things the note of a
brown creeper smote my ear cheerily, assuring
me that one little friend, at least,
was sharing my enjoyment.</p>
<p>After about two hours, during which
time the rain had not ceased to fall, I
set out on my return walk. The first
sound to attract attention, on again setting
foot out doors, was the crackling of
the needles in a tall pine tree, and I was
surprised to note that the rain was freezing
on the trees. It had not seemed cold
enough. Very soon there was sleet mixed
with the rain, which changed again presently
to snow and sleet. Then the snow
and the wind commenced a mad frolic,
and Oh! how beautiful they made the
world! Who could be deaf to the deep-toned
music of the wind roaring through
the upper branches of the trees!</p>
<p>The spirit of the storm entered into my
veins and a wild delight seized me. I
could have shouted aloud with the mere
joy of living. The redbird&rsquo;s call note
was as the greeting of a friend, and the
hairy woodpecker&rsquo;s loud &ldquo;pique&rdquo; seemed
to say &ldquo;Hi! down there; this is a world
worth living in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is in such moments as these that our
unity with Nature is most strongly felt
and our co-partnership with the elements
realized. We are as much a part of the
great and wonderful universe as the
stars or the clouds, the mountains or
the sea.</p>
<p>Thus may the storm spirit embrace our
spirit as the wind and rain and snow encircle
our bodies. If the invisible and
visible parts of our being be both equally
prepared to face the elements, we shall
return from our encounter with them
exalted in mind and refreshed in body;
with new life in our veins, and in our
hearts new wonder at the beauty of Nature
in her wilder moods.</p>

<h2 id="c20">THE VIOLET.</h2>
<p>With the exception of the rose, no
other plant is so widely distributed and
at the same time so universally admired
as the Violet. Not alone is it esteemed
because of its beauty and fragrance, but
a wealth of romance, of historical associations
and mythical lore have clustered
around the purple blossoms, endearing
them to the poet and scientist alike.</p>
<p>The Violet was formally baptized with
the ancient Latin name Viola in 1737.
Since that time, by some strange oversight,
botanists have allowed the name
to remain unchanged. Two hundred
and fifty species of the Violet have been
described, although a more careful study
of the genus has reduced the number
to one hundred or more species. Three-fourths
of these forms are found in the
temperate Northern Hemisphere and the
balance in the Southern. Under these
diverse conditions of growth the plants
assume many seemingly unnatural characteristics.
Thus, in Brazil a species of
Violet is eaten like spinach, while others
found in Peru are violent purgatives.
Among certain Gaelic tribes the plants
are highly esteemed as a cosmetic, and
the ancients largely used the flowers to
flavor wines.</p>
<p>Whatever other attributes a plant may
possess, it is predestined in large measure
to waste its fragrance on the desert
air, unless it catches the fancy of the
minstrel or tips the bolts that fly from
Cupid&rsquo;s bow. In fact, the Violets were
originally white, until they were accidentally
struck by Cupid&rsquo;s dart, which
was hurled at Diana, and since then the
petals have been &ldquo;purple with love&rsquo;s
wounds.&rdquo; Hence Shakespeare calls the
Violet &ldquo;Cupid&rsquo;s flower of purple dye.&rdquo;
Another reason for the change from
white to purple is found in the jealousy
of Venus, who, envious of Cupid&rsquo;s admiration
of the purity of the flowers,
changed them all to blue.</p>
<p>The Greek myth, however, would certainly
not be content if it could not more
fully account for the origin of the Violet,
and so it appears from the classic
legend that Ianthea, the most beautiful
of Diana&rsquo;s nymphs, while dancing in the
woodlands, was pursued by the sun god,
and in order to save her favorite the
immortal huntress changed her into a
Violet. The name Ion was given to the
plants by the Greeks after the nymphs of
Ionia presented the flowers to Jupiter.
The Thunderer evidently saw something
more than a mere blossom in the dainty
flowers, for it appears that the Violet
became a beautiful priestess in Juno&rsquo;s
temple, known as Io. In order to protect
her from the jealousy of his consort,
Jupiter was forced to change the
young goddess into a heifer, and whenever
she lowers her head to feed, the
white violet springs from her perfumed
breath as it comes in contact with the
soil.</p>
<p>Among the ancients the Violet was the
flower of honor. It was the sacred
flower of the Acropolis, and the &ldquo;Athenian
crowned with Violets&rdquo; was a distinction
much sought after. Pindar
writes of &ldquo;Violet-crowned Athens,&rdquo; and
in the &ldquo;Cyprea&rdquo; it is said that Violets
were among the perfumes employed by
Venus to win from Paris the prize of
beauty.</p>
<p>No less esteemed were the purple blossoms
among the more rugged people of
the North, for a Saxon legend tells how
Czernebogh, god of the Vandals, lived
with his beautiful daughter in a stately
castle. When Christianity swept through
Saxony, destroying all evidences of the
heathen faiths, the god and his castle
were turned into rocks, and the lovely
daughter became a Violet, nestling among
the crags. Whoever is fortunate enough
to discover the hidden flower will restore
the maiden and the castle to their original
form and may claim this Saxon Flora
as his bride.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>In Norse mythology the Violet is
called Tyr&rsquo;s flower, and this is the first
instance in which the modest plant became
disassociated from the realm of
love and assumed the guise of war. Tyr&rsquo;s
violet mantle, however, in later years,
fell upon the great Napoleon, who
adopted the flower as his emblem. He
was, in fact, called by his followers
Pere de la Violette, and upon going into
exile Napoleon assured his friends that
he would return with the Violets. Hence
the flower became the sacred symbol by
which his followers recognized each other.
When asked, &ldquo;Do you like the Violet?&rdquo;
if the reply was &ldquo;Oui&rdquo; the answerer
was not a confederate. If, however, the
reply came, &ldquo;Eh, bien,&rdquo; they recognized a
brother conspirator and completed the
sentence, &ldquo;It will appear again in the
spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the middle ages the Violet became
the chosen symbol to the minstrel
and troubadour, of loyalty and faithful
love. A blue Violet was the first love
token passed by Clemence Isaure through
a hole in the wall of her convent garden
to her noble lover, Count Raymond, of
Toulouse, and in its association as a
bridal flower Milton used it to carpet
Eve&rsquo;s bower in Paradise.</p>

</div>
<p>There are many plants that are closely
related to the mythology and folklore of
nations. This is even true of many that
are native only in our own young country.
The Liverwort, or Hepatica, as it
is more often called, though it is not entirely
free from mythical association
among the Indian tribes, does not enter
largely into their folklore.</p>
<p>This beautiful plant has, however,
been the inspiration of many poets.
Helen Chase calls the Hepaticas</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Hooded darlings of the spring,</p>
<p class="t0">Rarest tints of purple wearing.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The delicate blue of the flowers is
mentioned by William Cullen Bryant:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The liverleaf put forth her sister blooms</p>
<p class="t0">Of faintest blue.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The life of this plant is poetical. During
the summer months a luxuriant
growth of leaves is produced. As cold
weather approaches these lie down upon
the ground and are soon covered by the
falling leaves, which have been nipped
from the trees by bite of the frost king.
Soon, too, they are covered with snow.
In this warm cradle they sleep through
the winter, yet, as it were, with open
eyes for the dawn of spring. Had the
Hepatica the power of reason we would
say that it longed for spring, for after
the first few warm days that herald the
approach of that season there is activity
in every part of the plant. It does not
wait to produce new leaves, but in an
incredibly short time sends up its flower
stalk and spreads its blue, purple or
white petals to the warm rays of the sun.
The Hepatica is truly a harbinger of
spring, and in Eastern North America,
from Southern British America to the
Gulf of Mexico, its appearance introduces
the new season. In the northern
portion of its habitat its flowers are
among the first to grace the dreary, leafless
forests. This Hepatica is also found
in Europe and Asia. It is not only a
flower of the forests of lower altitudes,
but is also found in mountainous regions
at an elevation of nearly three thousand
feet.</p>
<p>This plant was first described by Linn&aelig;us
in 1753, who gave it the name Hepatica,
as he saw in the shape of the leaf
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
a resemblance to the form of the liver.</p>
<p>Of the four known species of Hepaticas
but one other is found in North
America. This species has the lobes of
the leaves pointed instead of round. In
some localities it is quite as common as
the plant of our illustration, and by many
it is considered merely a variety of that
form.</p>
<p>Bishop Coxe has said:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">Flowers are words</p>
<p class="t0">Which even a babe may understand.</p>
</div>
<p>The word expressed by the beautiful
and hardy Hepatica is confidence.</p>
<h2 id="c22">THE SPRING MIGRATION.
<br /><span class="small">I. THE WARBLERS.</span></h2>
<p>In two former papers I told you of
some of the birds that spend their winters
in the Gulf States. It is my purpose in
the present article to tell some of the
features of the great spring migration as
viewed from a Mississippi standpoint;
how myriads of the little fellows in yellow,
black, white, and olive-green stop in
these forests to rest and feed for a day
or two, then under the impulse of a little-understood
instinct continue their journey
to the region of their birth. The migration
takes place in successive waves,
till the last one breaks upon us and spring
is over.</p>
<p>In early March the first wave rolls in
upon us; happy little creatures hop about
and chatter among the opening buds and
feast on the insect life awakened by the
returning sun. On successive days or,
perhaps, at intervals of a few days other
waves roll in from the far lands of the
Gulf and the Caribbean Sea, till the final
one beats against these hills and we
awake about the first of May to realize
that summer, fervid, tropical, is here. For
the months of March and April all is bustle
among the feathered traveling public;
after that the summer residents have
things all their own way till the fall migration
begins.</p>
<p>As the sun draws near the line you notice
that up in the tops of the gum trees
are little birds about the size of a savanna
sparrow, and, viewed hastily, of much
the same coloring. You know they are
not savannas, because the savanna never
frequents such places. Some of them
have probably spent their winter in this
latitude; but just now by their restless
activity they tell us that the sap has begun
to stir and that the great migration
is about to begin. Closer inspection with
a good glass will show four spots or
patches of yellow, one on the crown, one
under each wing, and another on the
rump, hence the bird&rsquo;s name, the yellow
rumped warbler, sometimes known as the
myrtle warbler. A month later you will
scarcely recognize the males of this species,
the dull brown of the winter coat
being replaced by the shiny black of his
bridegroom&rsquo;s suit.</p>
<p>When the beech buds swell and the jessamine
puts forth its little yellow trumpets
to announce that spring has actually
come, the first great wave comes flooding
into the awakening woods. Here come
the first arrivals, both sexes in coats of
grayish blue, with shirtwaists of brilliant
yellow, the male distinguished by a patch
of rufous of an irregular crescent shape
across the lower part of the throat and
upper part of the breast. On fine sunshiny
days the parula warbler, for that
is his name, loves the topmost branches
of the tallest trees; if the day is gloomy
he comes down to the lower branches,
affording a better opportunity to study
him. His only note at these times is an
insect-like buzz much in keeping with
his diminutive size.</p>
<p>In the lowlands the Halesia or silver
bell is putting out its graceful pendulous
racemes of purest white, and it is time to
look for the next migrant, the hooded
warbler, one of the largest and finest of
his race. A V of brilliant yellow coming
down to the bill, covering the forehead
and running backwards past the eye, bordered
by a well defined band of intense
black, and a back and tail of green slightly
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
tinted with olive make him a marked bird.
Unlike the parula, he cares nothing for
treetops or sunshine; a perch on a swinging
rattan vine or in a shrub in the dark
woods hard by a canebrake is good
enough for him.</p>
<p>As soon as the hooded warbler appears
we will see the black and white creeping
warbler, the connecting link (so to
speak) between the creepers and warblers
in both appearance and habits. Like
our common brown creeper, he loves the
dense woods, but unlike him seems to
prefer the tops and higher branches. Alternate
patches and streaks of white and
black without a suggestion of the yellow
or olive green so characteristic of his
genus make his identification easy. His
note is simple and short; in fact the
sounds that he emits in his journeys are
scarcely worth being called a song.</p>
<p>The flood tide comes about the first
of April and lasts two weeks. Prominent
among the multitude of visitors you may
see a warbler slightly smaller than the
hooded but of the same general coloring,
yellow, black and green, only in this bird
the black is in three patches, one on the
top of the head, the others running from
the bill back and down. This is the Kentucky
warbler, a lover of the ground and
of the low growths. There is another
that the hasty observer might mistake for
the hooded or the Kentucky, and that is
the Maryland yellowthroat. The black
on the latter is confined to broad bands
of rich velvety black below the eyes; the
yellow is more of a sulphur than a chrome
shade, and the green is more nearly olive
than in the two just mentioned. Many
of this species make their summer home
in this latitude, making their nests and
rearing their broods in the mat of vines
and weeds along the fence rows. The
usual song is wichety, wichety, wichety,
uttered with the cheerful vigor that
makes the Carolina wren so attractive.
During the months of April and May,
1900, I had frequent opportunities to observe
two pairs of yellow throats that had
built just inside the fence that parallels
the railroad; the males, as they caught
sight of me coming down the track, would
mount the highest weed within reach and
sing with all their might, but as I came
opposite their perch would drop suddenly
down into the weeds and remain there
till I was well past, then resume their
perch and song as long as I was in hearing.</p>
<p>Another of this family conspicuous for
its brilliant coloring is the prothonotary
warbler. Yellow breast, head, neck and
shoulders, yellowish olive wings and back
and darker olive tail render him conspicuous
against any woodland background.
If you want to see him during these busy
April days we must go where he is, i. e.,
in the cypress or willow swamps. The
dark gray festoons of Spanish moss
(Tillandsia usneoides) and the tender
young green of the cypress leaves afford
both contrast for his bright colors and
provisions for his larder. Some of this
species also nest here, choosing for their
homes oftentimes the holes made by some
of our smaller woodpeckers in dead willow
stubs. I remember one morning seeing
a cheerful flock of prothonotary and
parula warblers and noticing one of the
former leave his companions and fly to
a clump of willows where another less
brilliantly colored, presumably the female,
joined him. Together they inspected the
willow stubs, running in and out and up
and down the trunks, peering into every
cavity. Finally they found one that met
their requirements, then, after a short but
earnest discussion, flew away through the
swamp.</p>
<p>Inhabiting the marshes and swamps is
the Louisiana water thrush, a slender
brown bird shaped much like the brown
thrasher, only much smaller, being about
six inches in length as compared with the
thrasher&rsquo;s eleven or twelve. A gifted
singer, he is very wild and shy, always
resenting the intrusion of the lords of
creation upon his quiet haunts, flitting
quietly on before you in the shadows,
evincing his distrust of your motives by
an occasional angry &ldquo;clink.&rdquo; He well
illustrates the principle of compensation:
though denied the brilliant yellows and
greens of his warbler brethren, he surpasses
them all in the quality of his song,
as free, as beautiful, as wild as the bird
himself. All the individuals of this species
that I saw in three years&rsquo; observation
were either in the water beeches (Carpinus
caroliniana) that grew so thickly
along the creek or in the sweet gums
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
and cypress along the borders of an immense
swamp.</p>
<p>As the Louisiana water thrush is the
star soloist of the warbler contingent, so
the yellow breasted chat is the clown of
our woodland troupe. His coloring is
vivid but simple, being green with a wash
of olive above, lores black, breast bright
chrome yellow, other under parts white
or whitish. Under most circumstances
this bird is shy and difficult to approach,
as I learned by personal experience; but
when one of his strange moods comes
upon him&mdash;perhaps it is the approach of
the nuptial season that so affects him&mdash;he
doffs much of his shyness and becomes
a veritable clown, making such a profusion
and variety of noises that one would
fain believe that there is a whole score
of birds in the bush or thicket from which
the medley proceeds. He darts out of
his retreat and flies away over the shrubbery,
twisting and turning his body, raising
and dropping his tail as if all his
joints were of the ball and socket pattern,
making as many ridiculous contortions
and as many varieties of squeaks and
squalls as an old-time elocutionist.</p>
<p>Besides numerous individuals of the
species of warblers already named, in the
two weeks between April 9 and 23 I saw
one or more of each of the following:
Yellow or summer, bluewinged, worm-eating,
magnolia, golden winged, chestnut
sided, prairie, and the redstart. As I
write these names they call up mornings
spent in the land of the &rsquo;possum and persimmon
while yet the steamy breath of
the dew was going up to meet the fervor
of an April sun, and all the air was
heavy with the perfume of the blooming
holly, mornings of music from a thousand
throats inspired by &ldquo;the new wine
of the year.&rdquo; At such times one realizes
the force of these two lines from Richard
Hovey:</p>

<h2 id="c23">A PET SQUIRREL.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Grandma, what made those little
scars on this finger?&rdquo; asked Nellie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those,&rdquo; said grandma, reflectively,
&ldquo;were made by a saucy little gray squirrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was a little girlie, smaller than
you, uncle gave me a gray squirrel in
a cage for a pet. As we all fondled him
he soon became very tame. We often
opened his cage door and allowed him to
run around the house at will. One day
he ran upstairs and played havoc in
a feather bed. After that when out of
his cage we kept a close watch on him,
never allowing him in a bedroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he had already learned a new
trick which he seemed very loth to forget.
Every time that he could sneak into
a bedroom he would make a bee-line
for the bed, tear a hole in the tick and
be inside among the feathers in a flash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I said before, everyone around the
place petted and handled him and he had
never bitten nor scratched anyone. But
one day while playing with him he suddenly
leaped from my arms and raced
upstairs. Just as he jumped upon a bed
I caught him. This angered his squirrel-ship.
He turned and savagely ran his
long, sharp teeth through my finger. The
sores were slow about healing and left
these little scars. After that mother
would not allow me to let him out of his
cage.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="t0">Children fill the groves with the echoes of their glee,</p>
<p class="t">Gathering tawny chestnuts, and shouting when beside them</p>
<p class="t0">Drops the heavy fruit of the tall black-walnut tree.</p>
<p class="lr">&mdash;William Cullen Bryant: &ldquo;The Third of November.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The English walnut, butternut, black
walnut, shagbark or shellbark hickory,
mockernut or whiteheart hickory, bitternut
hickory and pignut hickory are closely
related, belonging to the butternut
family, or technically the Juglandace&aelig;.
They are large, handsome trees, with
spreading branches and cleancut leaves.
They are of comparative slow growth
but hardy and enduring.</p>
<p>The English walnut is a tall, large,
handsome tree which undoubtedly came
from India. The name walnut is from
Walish or Welsch nut; Juglans from
Jovis glans, meaning the nut of Jove,
and regia, meaning royal, hence the royal
nut of Jove. The Greeks dedicated the
tree to their chief deity Zeus, who corresponds
to the chief deity of the Romans,
namely, Jove or Jupiter. At a Greek
wedding the nuts were scattered among
the guests that Zeus might bless the marriage.
The tree was described by numerous
ancient writers, among others by
Dioscorides, Plinius, Varro, Columella,
and Palladius. Medicinal and other virtues
were ascribed to the fruit and leaves
and even to the shade of this remarkable
tree. Arabian physicians used the hull
of the unripe fruit and the leaves medicinally,
Karl der Grosse (Charlemagne)
recommended the cultivation of this plant
in Germany about 812. It was introduced
into the Mediterranean countries at an
early period and extensively cultivated.
From these countries it rapidly spread
to northern Europe, and about 1562 it
found its way into the British Isles, where
it is extensively cultivated. It is cultivated
somewhat in the United States.</p>
<p>All the other members of the Juglandace&aelig;
are common throughout the United
States, either growing wild or under
cultivation. The wood of the butternut
or white walnut and that of the black
walnut is extensively used in cabinet
making, furniture making and interior
finish, particularly the wood of the black
walnut. The earlier craze for black walnut
furniture threatened to exterminate
the plant, but fortunately (for the walnut
tree) the fashion is waning. The wood
is heavy, dark brown in color, of medium
hardness, easily worked and readily polished,
though it does not take the glossy
polish of the harder woods, as ebony.
Hickory wood is very hard, tough and
durable, but it is not suitable for cabinet
making, etc., because it warps too much.
It is an excellent wood for making handles
for tools of all descriptions, oxen
yokes, hoops, walking sticks, whiffletrees,
wagon stocks, etc. Its tensile strength is
enormous, being said to be equal to that
of wrought iron.</p>
<p>The seeds (kernels) of the English
walnut, butternut, black walnut and shagbark
hickory are edible and greatly relished,
while those of the bitter and pignut
hickories are not edible. Eating too
many of the kernels causes distressing
dyspeptic symptoms because of the large
amount of oil which they contain. Salting
the kernels before eating or taking
a little salt with them is said to lessen
these disturbances. The oil of these nuts
is expressed and used as a salad oil and
by artists in mixing pigments. The half-grown
green fruits of the walnuts are
pickled with spices and eaten, but as such
relishes have never come into great favor.
They are too severe in their action on the
intestinal tract, due to the tannin, acids
and coloring substances present. The
hulls of these nuts are used in dyeing
cloth; also the bark of the butternut and
black walnut. The leaves and hull of the
English walnut and the inner bark of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
roots of the butternut are still quite extensively
used medicinally. A decoction
of the leaves is said to cure gout, scrofula
and rickets. The hulls are recommended
in gout and eruptive skin diseases.
Fresh leaves are applied as a
fomentation to carbuncles. The extract
is used as a gargle, wash for ulcerous
eruptions and taken internally in tubercular
meningitis. The juice of the green
hull has been extensively employed as a
popular remedy to remove warts, as an
external application for skin diseases, and
internally as a stomachic and worm remedy.
The medicinal virtues of these plants
are, however, apparently limited and unreliable.</p>
<p>The nut so-called of the English walnut,
black walnut, butternut and hickory
nut consists of the kernel (seed) and the
inner layer (endocarp) of the fruit coat
(pericarp). The endocarp, which is ordinarily
designated as the shell, is very
hard and splits more or less easily into
two equal parts. The shell of the English
walnut is comparatively thin and quite
easily removed from the kernel. The shell
of black walnut and butternut is
very rough, very dark in color,
thick, and not so easily removed
from the seed or kernel. The hickory
shell is quite difficult to remove. The
kernels are eaten direct or added to cake,
cake frosting, and other pastry, or encased
by sugar and chocolate by the candy
maker. The halves of the shell of the
English walnut figure conspicuously in
the well known &ldquo;shell game&rdquo; of the gambler
who seems to be the central figure
at county fairs and many circuses.</p>
<p>As already stated, the trees belonging
to the butternut or hickory family grow
quite slowly, and do not attain their full
growth for many years. In our latitude
the nuts are planted in the fall when they
begin to germinate late the following
spring. In order to give the trees free
growth they should be planted at least
thirty feet apart. They begin to bear
fruit at about the tenth year, few nuts at
first, but gradually more and more each
year, and they continue to bear for many
years. The leaves, buds and green fruits
have a resinous, characteristic aromatic
odor, recalling the lemon. All who have
ever handled leaves, green bark and fruit
will remember that the juice colors the
skin a dark brown which is very difficult
to remove.</p>
<p>The fruit of the black walnut and butternut
when ripe is gathered, the hulls
removed by stamping with mauls, the
nuts dried for a week in the sun and then
stored for use. The hull of the English
walnut and the hickory nut is quite easily
removed.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
